Standalone GPS log converter for the Maemo GPS Recorder.

This version of the program runs on a regular Qt 4.6 system, and creates GPX files with a bit more information than the standard version of this program: the horizontal/vertical uncertainty in cm are saved in "extensions".

To install, open the .pro file in Qt Creator.
To run, use ./gpsrecorder gpsr_file1 gpsr_fie

GPS Recorder for Maemo

A GPS data logger for the Maemo platform (Nokia N900).

It is written in C++, over the Qt framework and gets GPS data from Maemo's
liblocation.

Main features:
* Gather as much information as possible from the GPS subsystem at a desired
  frequency (time, satellites, fix loss, etc...).
* Export your saved tracks to KML/KMZ, GPX and/or CSV files in a single
  operation.
* Snap and name a position (POI) while recording to see it later on a map.
* Automatically update system time according to GPS time when it is accurate
  enough.
